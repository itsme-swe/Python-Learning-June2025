# ðŸ’¥ reverse() method is an inbuilt method in Python that reverses the order of elements in a list. This method modifies the original list and does not return a new list, which makes it an efficient way to perform the reversal without unnecessary memory uses.

l1 = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

l1.reverse()

print(l1)  # [10, 8, 6, 4, 2]
