# ðŸ”¶ The join() method in Python is used to concatenate the elements of an iterable (such as a list, tuple, or set) into a single string with a specified delimiter placed between each element.

need_to_visit = ["Leh", "Nubra", "Pangong", "Hanle", "Umilang"]

str = ", ".join(need_to_visit)

print(str)  # Leh, Nubra, Pangong, Hanle, Umilang
